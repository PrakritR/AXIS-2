/**
 * The resident-role check went from PERMISSIVE-ON-ABSENT to FAIL-CLOSED.
 *
 * Before: `loadResidentPortalAccessStateCached` used
 * `roleOk = !role || role === "resident"`, and `/api/resident/extend-lease` and
 * `/api/resident/check-move-out-availability` used
 * `if (role && role !== "resident") 403` — every one of them ADMITTED an account
 * whose legacy `profiles.role` is null or blank. Now `authorizeResidentRole` is
 * the single predicate for all of them, and an absent legacy role no longer
 * admits anyone by itself.
 *
 * Failing closed is right, but the cost of getting it wrong is asymmetric: a
 * resident locked out of their own lease and payments is worse than a slightly
 * wider check. So the load-bearing property is the FALLTHROUGH — an account
 * whose legacy role is null/blank but which holds the resident role in
 * `profile_roles` must still be admitted. This file pins that in both places it
 * matters: the shared predicate, and one of the named routes end to end.
 *
 * Measured against the production project (`prop-lane production`) on
 * 2026-08-03, replaying both predicates over all 28 accounts: 5 are newly
 * refused and ZERO of them have any resident data — all 5 are `auth.users` rows
 * with no `profiles` row, no `profile_roles` rows, and no application, lease, or
 * charge. 2 accounts are newly ADMITTED (the manager+resident multi-role fix), so
 * for real residents the change is net-widening. No resident was locked out.
 *
 * Sibling coverage: `resident-portal-access.test.ts` (the resolver / nav stage)
 * and `resident-role-authorization-surface.test.ts` (the static drift guard that
 * stops a route hand-rolling the legacy read again).
